# Little Forum Thing (WIP)

This is an open source forum software meant to be easy to use and deploy. Work in progress.

Tech stack:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for UI (with [Primevue](https://www.primefaces.org/primevue/) as a component library)
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) as the framework
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for database, cloud storage and authentication

## Philosophy

This is meant to be a simple forum software with a small amount of configuration. At the moment, configuration is done by editing `forum-config.ts` at the root, though eventually some of those options might be moved to an admin panel and stored in the database.

## Environmnt variables

Environment variables are required for the forum to connect to supabase. The values can be found in the project settings -> API section of Supabase.

The following fields need to be added to a `.env` file at the root of the project:

```.env
SUPABASE_URL="[supabase url]"
SUPABASE_KEY="[supabase anon public key]"
```

Note: Those values are not sensitive, so they can be public without issues. The project currently doesn't require any secret keys to run.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16 recommended)
- Environment variables need to be setup

`npm install` to install dependencies.

`npm run dev` to run the forum

## Deploying

As a nuxt app, the forum can easily be deployed to a variety of hosting platforms that support node.js. The easiest recommended way to deploy it is to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) which has built-in compatibility with Nuxt.

Environment variables will need to be configured for the deployment, as mentioned above.

Deploying is simply a matter of importing the project in Vercel and letting it deploy it.

## Database schema

The database schema is currently not in the repo as an `SQL` file as I have been editing the database schema directly in Supabase to save time, so to run the project you can either reproduce the same Supabase setup manually, or just use the development database the project is currently running on:

### Using existing dev Supabase

Simply put this in `.env`

```
SUPABASE_URL="https://rgitljlknjfprwfejlty.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InJnaXRsamxrbmpmcHJ3ZmVqbHR5Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE2Njg0NDQyNjQsImV4cCI6MTk4NDAyMDI2NH0.FdMKZVG1mCksEVPelE8QxhCr5BxwhmsNr646pegoGRo"
```

### Using your own Supabase

The `sql` folder contains query files that can be added and run in Supabase to setup security policies, storage buckets and the trigger function that creates new users in the `users` table when they sign up. This should set up most things, but the tables need to be manually created.

The [lib/database.types.ts](https://github.com/liana-p/liana-forum-thing/blob/main/lib/database.types.ts) in this repo has been auto-generated by exporting the database schema from Supabase, so it can be used as a reference for the database schema.

Three tables need to be setup:

- `profiles`: Stores users
- `threads`: Stores threads. The `created_by` field is a foreign key to the `profiles` table.
- `replies`: Stores replies to threads. The `created_by` field is a foreign key to the `profiles` table, and the `thread_id` field is a foreign key to the `threads` table.

Once those tables are setup, running the queries in the `sql` folder should setup all their security policies.

One last necessary thing is to make the `avatars` bucket public.
